                We advance peopleâ€™s rights to their freedom of information by offering a standardized and consolidated way to access all publicly available information generated by the U.S. government. We do so by providing  a conceptual data lake that covers more than 400 government databases and offer users a single GraphQL API inspired endpoint to access all that information accurately and efficiently.

                The sample below is a graphical query builder. ThrorMap provides two ways of accessing our service, graphical user interface hosted on this website and direct HTTP API access.
